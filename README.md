# hospital_queue_management_system
In modern hospitals, managing patient queues efficiently is a critical challenge. Traditional first-come, first-served (FCFS) approaches fail to prioritize critical cases, leading to delays in urgent care. This Hospital Queue Management System aims to optimize patient handling using priority-based queueing, ensuring that critically ill patients receive immediate attention while maintaining a structured order for others. The system utilizes concepts, such as priority queues, greedy algorithms, and object-oriented programming, to dynamically manage patient entries, removals, and real-time queue visualization. By implementing an efficient priority-driven approach, the system enhances hospital workflow, reduces patient wait times, and ensures timely medical attention for those in need.
